Web/Mobile App Development

ChoreChamp is an app for families/households to delegate household chores. This app will also have a reward system – mostly geared toward families with children so that parents can grant children’s requests based on if the number of points the children have accumulated. The goal of this app is to help people organize tasks such as cleaning, cooking, studying, etc. and have them listed in a singular app that can be shared with multiple people.
