## Self Assessment: Sydni-Dee Venter

For our senior design project, we are wanting to design a home app that helps organize household chores and motivate those in the home to do them! To do this,
there will be a option for the heads of the household to add, edit, and remove chores and add point values to them. Once the chores are complete, the one who did
them receives points. In creating this app, the classes that I have taken that will aide the team will be Data Structures (CS2028C) and Database Design (CS4092).
These two classes will help plan how we will write the logic of the app and how we will be designing the database to hold the chores and points.

My coop experience will be extremely helpful in the development of the project. During one of my rotations at GE AViation, my manager gave me the freedom to develop
my own website and learn about cloud services. This will be helpful as I now have experience setting up a database and making sure the app and database are working 
correctly. At my most recent experience at PNC Bank, I got a plethora of experience seeing a project from start to finish and how to drive the process. I was in
charge of the communication between the business end and development teams to make sure the product was on the right track. I can use this to make sure my team is
making an app that will be useful to families by conduction peer/family reviews and making sure we are meeting all our deadlines.

The motivations for this project was that we all come from big families where organizing chores was chaotic. In my experience, I also nanny through college. The 
current household that I am in has huge issues managing chores. I found an app similar to this one that we started using but there was many flaws in it. I tried
finding one that would accurately fit the needs of the family but I was not successful. In creating this one, I hope to be able to make something that works in a
way that would benefit this family the most.

My expectations for this project is to have a fully fleshed app. I would like to continue getting input from our own families through the development phase so that
we are able to create something great! We will know when we are done when we have accomplished all of the main features that we want and have received all the 
input necessary. For personal contributions, I would want the team to openly communicate when something needs to get done and what each person needs to do. If 
someone isn't meeting expecatations, again, I want the team to communicate that before it becomes a problem.
