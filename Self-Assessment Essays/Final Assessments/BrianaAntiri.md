## Part A: 

My individual contribution to this project was mainly the code and being scrum master. We developed and designed an android mobile app to keep track of household chores. I mainly programmed the login/registration flow, the family tab, and profile display of the application. I definitely was able to apply the knowledge I had gained from previous courses such as Data Structures (CS2028C) and Database Design (CS4092) when developing the app. Although we used Firebase to store our user and household data, a lot of the same principles discussed in Database Design were applicable to the process of navigating through our database in code with Java. In conjunction with the database navigation, our team was able to implement different data structures–such as Arrays, Lists, HashMaps–to store the Household & User data efficiently. With these structures that we initially learned about in Data Structures, it was easy to devise potential solutions for storing data. 

As for new things I learned, this was the first time I have developed anything in Android Studio from scratch in addition to working with other people who had limited knowledge on Android development. Navigating through the Android Studio IDE was a challenge at first but we all caught on after a few weeks. One aspect of building an app that I learned through this project was design. From building out the workflow to designing the logo, to re-designing certain features was really difficult. Although I have done something similar before, this time we had to be really creative with our design as there were many aspects of our app that depended on one another. Without mapping out how we wanted the app to look, we would have had a challenging time deciding which data structures to use and which classes need to be created in order for our app to run successfully.

## Part B: 

As a group we were able to accomplish developing a full Minimum Viable Product as well as a Figma design for additional features that could be added once the core features had been tested. The most important thing I learned about working in a group is that there has to be some constant type of meeting otherwise it is difficult to hold everyone accountable. As a team, we decided to meet every Thursday to discuss the project at the very least. Eventually we got to a point where we designated Tuesdays as our “work days” where we would spend 4-5 hours doing paired programming so all of us could understand why certain aspects of the app were developed in a certain way. This is also the first time in awhile where I had to use git branches since COVID as I have not been working on that many projects recently. Given my hiatus, I often found myself working off of old branches or forgetting to pull and resolving massive merge conflicts. While this was a personal obstacle, my team members helped me re-learn the best process for collaborating with Git and we were able to work efficiently together. 

If there is anyone I’d like to give special recognition to, it would be Faith Tremmel and Sydni-Dee Venter. Faith handled a lot of the programming aspect as well and she was completely new to Android development but she accomplished a lot in the short time we had to build our app. She was able make the process of calling database information more efficient and streamlined with a global FirebaseDatabase class and found creative solutions whenever we were stuck as a group. For Sydni-Dee, she handled a lot of the non-technical aspects of the project. She came up with the logo, the workflow design, our PowerPoint design, and the User Story we shared during our presentation.
