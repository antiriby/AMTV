## Part A
While working on this project, my main contributions were writing the code. I created the rewards page and header bar. I also helped debug and made small changes to the family and tasks pages as well.

Looking at my initial assessment, I definitely accomplished what I had hoped while working on this project. I was able to use a lot of the skills I had learned during my college career, such as working with databases and programming in java. Additionally, I was able to learn a lot of new skills like using Android Studios and Firebase to create an Android application. Since these were new technologies, using them involved a huge learning curve. It took many additional hours and debugging to figure out how to use them. Another obstacle was getting the app on Android Studios to look like the design on Figma. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to customize the components in Android Studios to make them look the way we wanted. 
## Part B
Over the course of the past year, our team was able to create a working application. While we didnâ€™t have time to implement all of the features we had initially hoped to, we were able to narrow down our scope to create a functioning product. We were also able to create a full Figma design for our project with all of the features we could add to the application.

While working on this project, I learned a lot about teamwork. Every team works together differently, so it was definitely a learning experience when figuring out how our team worked best together. I learned that communication and patience were two key factors to working successfully with my team. One aspect that worked well for us was meeting at least once a week to share our progress and work on the project together.
