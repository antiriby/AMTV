Once you have created an account, you need to login to the application before being able to use it.

If you do not have an account yet, you will need to create one before being able to login.

On the login page are the following fields:
* username or email
* password

For the first field you can either enter the username you created while setting up your account, or simply use your email.

Enter the password you created at account registration.

If you would like your login information to be saved to reduce the number of sign ins, check the "Remember me" checkbox above the "Login" button.

Tap the Login button.
